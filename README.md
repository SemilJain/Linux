# Linux Assignments

This repository contains a set of basic Linux assignments that I completed as a part of my training at Quantiphi Inc. These assignments cover various Linux commands and operations. Below, you'll find details on each assignment along with the respective input files.

## Assignment 1 - Search and Count
This assignment involves searching for a specific word ("the") in the `input1.txt` file and counting the occurrences.

## Assignment 2 - List Text Files
This task simply lists all the text files in the current directory.

## Assignment 3 - Explore Subdirectories
This assignment explores subdirectories with names starting with "aws_". It prints the current directory for each subdirectory found.

## Assignment 4 - Replace Text
In this task, we replace all instances of "learning" with "writing" in the input2.txt file.

## Assignment 5 - Extract Data
This assignment uses jq to extract data from the s3_info.txt file, specifically the ARN of the S3 buckets.
