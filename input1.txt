Tyrion walks through what’s left of King’s Landing, warily eyeing the ash that falls like snow. The ruins are still on fire; flames lick the corpses and rubble that the line the streets. Davos and Jon, as well as some others, follow at a distance, and it’s eerily quiet. “I’ll find you later,” he says when they catch up, and though Jon wants to send some men to accompany him, Tyrion continues solo. “I’m going alone,” he says as he treads on.

Elsewhere, Grey Worm has got a bunch of Lannister soldiers on their knees, and he announces that he’s going to kill them, under Daenerys’ commands: “Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister.” When Jon and Davos try to stop him, the Unsullied surrounding them draw their spears against them. Davos deescalates the situation, calmly telling Jon they’ll speak with the queen. And as they leave, Grey Worm begins the killing, slitting the throat of the prisoner of war closest to him.

Tyrion winds up in the Red Keep. He lights a torch and descends into the bowels of the castle, then winds up abandoning it to crawl past some debris that’s blocking his path. As he climbs on top of a pile of bricks, he notices Jaime’s golden hand peeking out from the rubble. Tyrion clears enough of the wreckage to see his dead siblings, then he begins to sob.
